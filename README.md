# Repository contains plugins for [ImJoy](https://imjoy.io)

Plugin repository for ImJoy.IO, with a special focus on deep learning applications.

See <https://github.com/oeway/ImJoy> for more details.

## Dependencies and tags

The provided deep learning plugins are built on open-source Python libraries
with specific dependencies. For these plugins we therefore provide different
`tags`, that allow to control which libraries are installed. Frequently, we use
`GPU` and `CPU` to determine if the plugin is running on a CPU or GPU.
